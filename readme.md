MIS 6900 - HW3 - HLong - Vehicle Miles Traveled in the United States

COVID has had a huge impact on vehicle miles traveled (VMT) so being in the auto industry, I wanted to analyze some trends with the data.
My data source appears to be a third-party site but they do say the source of the data is the Federal Highway Administration (FHA) so I feel okay about the data.
This webscrape / analysis is strictly related to data in the United States.


My assignment is pretty self-explanatory. I webscraped a pretty simple website that only had two columns of data but it was broken out in multiple tables; 
so I guess that was my challenge.

This is more weighted towards EDA since that is my comfort zone but it was difficult to do a lot with the data I pulled. I tried over and over to
get the one widget right (year + month) but it just did not work. No matter what I did, my widgets did not want to connect to the plot. I did get one 
widget to work, just not one that I found super useful.

Overall I enjoyed this assignment. It may not look like a lot of code but my Python skills are very basic and I knew nothing about HTML going in to 
this so i was impressed I could even get the webscrape to work. 

Thanks for a challenging course and being available to answer my questions.
